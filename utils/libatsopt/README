# How to build libatsopt.a
#
######

Assume that ATS1 is already installed.

Please execute the following command-lines

cd ${PATSHOME}/src
make libatsopt; make CBOOT
cd ${PATSHOME}/src/CBOOT; make libatsopt

after checking out ATS2-github, that is, the
version of ATS2 stored in the following directory:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

The libatsopt.a built in this way needs to be
used together with libgmp (-lgmp). To build a
version of libatsopt.a that does not depend on
libgmp, please execute the following command-lines
instead:

cd ${PATSHOME}/src
make C3NSTRINTKND=intknd libatsopt; make CBOOTmin
cd ${PATSHOME}/src/CBOOT; make libatsopt
