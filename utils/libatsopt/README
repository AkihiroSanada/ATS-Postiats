# How to build libatsopt.a
#
######

Please execute the following command-lines:

cd ${PATSHOME}/src; make libatsopt
cd ${PATSHOME}/src/CBOOT; make libatsopt

The libatsopt.a built in this way needs to be
used together with libgmp (-lgmp). To build a
version of libatsopt.a that does not depend on
libgmp, please execute the following command-lines:

cd ${PATSHOME}/src
make C3NSTRINTKND=intknd libatsopt
cd ${PATSHOME}/src/CBOOTmin; make libatsopt
