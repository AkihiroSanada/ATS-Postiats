# Atspkgreloc

A utility for relocating files referenced in ATS source code

## Motivation for Atspkgreloc

When programming in ATS, a programmer can often find it very convenient to
be able to make use of remotely located packages.  When ATS source code
involving use of remotely located packages needs to be compiled,
atspkgreloc can readily called to copy these packages to a local directory
before actual compilation starts.
