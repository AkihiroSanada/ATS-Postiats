HX-2013-10:

I have set up a project at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

This project primarily consists of external contributions made to the
ATS2 programming language system in the forms of library packages, tutorials,
examples, and all sorts of documentation, etc.

# Guidelines for contributing to ATS2
#
######

First, please choose a libats userid. For instance, my own libats user id
is 'hwxi' and my contributed code goes into a directory named libats-hwxi.
You can essentially put anything in your own libats directory. However,
there are certain conventions that I strongly recommend to be followed so
as to greatly facilitate the use of contributed code.

Say that you want to contribute a package called MYLIB. You should usually
create the following directories (if applicable):

SATS: This directory is for storing sats files. Normally, various abstract
types and function interfaces are declared in these sats files.

DATS: This directory is for storing dats files. Normally, various functions
declared in the previously mentioned sats files are implemented in these
dats files.

CATS: This directory is for storing cats files, which need to be included
in the C target code generated from ATS source code that makes use of MYLIB.

HATS: This directory is for storing hats files, which are often some files
that need to be included in the previously mentioned dats files. Note that
the need for this directory is less common.
