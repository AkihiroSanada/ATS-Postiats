This directory contains some examples demonstrating a general
approach to generating portable C code from ATS source that can
be compiled on other platforms for which patscc is not yet installed
or even available.

Often, portable C code generated from ATS source can be compiled
by issuing the following command-line:

gcc -I${PATSHOME} -I${PATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime <some-other-flags> *_?ats.c

If a Makefile is used to generate C code in an example, then you
should be able to use the same Makefile to compile the generated C code
by issuing the following command-line:

make MYCCRULE=PORTABLE -f /path/to/Makefile

or

make CC=clang MYCCRULE=PORTABLE -f /path/to/Makefile

######

Note that various needed CATS-files (corresponding to header files in C)
are contained in the package ATS2-Postiats-include-xxx, where xxx is the
version number of the package. For instance ATS2-Postiats-include-0.0.4
is available at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/files/ats2-lang/ats2-postiats-0.0.4/

for slightly more advanced examples.
