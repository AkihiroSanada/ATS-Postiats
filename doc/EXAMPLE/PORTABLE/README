# Generating portable C code

######

HX-2014-01-01:

This directory contains some examples demonstrating a general
approach to generating portable C code from ATS source that can
be compiled on other platforms for which patscc is not yet installed
or even available.

Often, portable C code generated from ATS source can be compiled
by issuing the following command-line:

gcc -I${PATSHOME} -I${PATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime <some-other-flags> *_?ats.c

Various CATS-files (corresponding to header files in C) are contained
in the following package:

ATS2-Postiats-include-0.0.4.tgz

which is available at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/files/ats2-lang/ats2-postiats-0.0.4/
