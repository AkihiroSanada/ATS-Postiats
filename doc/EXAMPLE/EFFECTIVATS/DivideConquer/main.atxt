<h1>
Effective ATS:<br>
Let's build a template-based package!
</h1>

##para('\

ATS is a feature-rich language, and dependent types, linear types and
embeddable templates can be seen as three of its most prominent
features. The richness of programming features can potentially make it
highly demanding for a programmer to rein in the inherent complexity
associated with ATS. In this article, I would like to present a
template-based package that is designed to (partially) relieve a
programmer of the heavy burden that is so often associated with
programming in ATS.
