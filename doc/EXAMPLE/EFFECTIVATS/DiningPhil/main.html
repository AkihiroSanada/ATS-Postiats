<h1>
Effective ATS: Dining Philosophers
</h1>

The three most distinguished features of ATS are dependent types, linear
types, and localizable templates. In this article, I present an
implementation of the famous problem of 5-Dining-Philosophers by Dijkstra
that makes simple but convincing use of linear types.

<h2>
Description of the Problem 
</h2>

There are five philosophers sitting around a table and there are also 5
forks placed on the table such that each fork is located between the left
hand of a philosopher and the right hand of another philosopher. Each
philosopher does the following routine repeatedly: thinking and dining.  In
order to dine, a philosopher needs to first acquire two forks: one located
on his left-hand side and the other on his right-hand side. After
finishing dining, a philosopher puts the two acquired forks onto the table:
one on his left-hand side and the other on his right-hand side.

<h2>
Linear Types for Resources
</h2>

First, let us introduce a type definition as follows:

<pre>
typedef phil = int
</pre>

The sole purpose of using [phil] instead of [int] as the type for
philosophers is to make it easier to comprehend the presented code.

<p>

Let us next introduce as follows a linear abstract type for forks (which
are resources):

<pre>
absvt@ype fork = int
</pre>

Note that this declaration means that [fork] is an abstract viewtype
(that is, a linear abstract type) whose size equals the size of [int].

<pre>
fun phil_acquire_lfork (n: phil): fork
fun phil_release_lfork (n: phil, f: fork): void
</pre>

<pre>
fun phil_acquire_rfork (n: phil): fork
fun phil_release_rfork (n: phil, f: fork): void
</pre>
