<h1>
Effective ATS:<br>
Linear Streams for Memory-Clean Programs
</h1>

##para('\
I find that linear streams are a true gem in ATS. It seems a bit
unfortunate that this gem is largely hidden from most programmers. I
would like to present a few short examples in this artice that
can demonstrate a typical use of linear streams in the construction of
memory-clean programs. Note that a program being memory-clean means
that the program must free every byte of memory allocated during its
execution at the point when it terminates. It should be clear soon that
the presented memory-clean programs also have a very small memory
footprint, making them suitable to run on devices where memory is extremely
limited (e.g., Arduio Uno).
