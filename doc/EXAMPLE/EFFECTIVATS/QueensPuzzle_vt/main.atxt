<h1>
Effective ATS:<br>
Solving Queens Puzzle memory-cleanly
</h1>

##para('\ I find that linear (lazy) streams are a true gem in ATS.  It
is a bit unfortunate that this gem is largely hidden from most
programmers. I would like to present a short example in this artice
that demonstrates a typical use of linear streams in the construction
of a memory-clean program. Note that a program being memory-clean
means that the program must free every byte of memory allocated during
its execution at the point when it terminates.
