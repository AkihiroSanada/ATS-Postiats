In the following implementation of a function for copying files, I intend
to demonstrate a typical and highly effective way of employing absviewtypes
(that is, abstract linear types).

In order to copy the content of one file into anther, we needs a means to
refer to the involved files.

%{
(* end of [main.atxt] *)
%}
