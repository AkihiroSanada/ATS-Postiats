<h1>
Effective ATS: Parallel Sorting
</h1>

<p>
In this article, I present an implementation of parallel merge-sort in the
continuation-passing style (CPS), which achieves high concurrency
by completely eliminating the need for explicit synchronization. It is
expected that this style of implementation can be readily applied to
various other algorithms based on the so-called divide-and-conquer strategy
(for problem-solving).
</p>

<p>
There is an article in the Effective-ATS series available
<a href="http://ats-lang.sourceforge.net/EXAMPLE/EFFECTIVATS/mergesort/index.html">on-line</a>,
which contains some detailed explanation on implementing (top-down) merge-sort.
</p>

<h2>
Sequential Mergesort
</h2>

<p>

Let us first declare a function #dyncode("mergesort") as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats('\
fun
{a:t@ype}
mergesort{n:int}(xs: list(a, n)): list(a, n)
')</pre>

which takes a list of length N and returns another list of the same length.
Strictly speaking, #dyncode("mergesort") is a function template, which can
be instantiated with any given type T to form a function for sorting a list
in which each element is of the type T.

</p>

<p>

A sequential implementation of #dyncode("mergesort") is given as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats('\
implement
{a}(*tmp*)
mergesort(xs) =
msort(xs, length(xs)) where
{
//
fun
msort{n:int}
(
xs: list(a, n), n: int(n)
) : list(a, n) =
(
if
(n >= 2)
then let
  val n2 = n / 2
  val (xs1, xs2) = list_split<a>(xs, n2)
  val ys1 = msort(xs1, n2) and ys2 = msort(xs2, n - n2)
in
  list_merge<a>(ys1, ys2)
end // end of [then]
else xs // end of [else]
) (* end of [msort] *)
//
} (* end of [mergesort] *)
')</pre>

Note that the functions #dyncode("list_split") and #dyncode("list_merge")
are given the following types:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats('\
//
fun
{a:t@ype}
list_merge
{n1,n2:int}
  (xs: list(a, n1), ys: list(a, n2)): list(a, n1+n2)
//
fun
{a:t@ype}
list_split
{n:int}{k:nat | k <= n}
  (xs: list(a, n), k: int(k) ): (list(a, k), list(a, n-k))
//
')</pre>

The function #dyncode("list_merge") merges two given lists (that are
ordered) into one (that is ordered).
The function #dyncode("list_split") splits a given list into two parts
where the first part is a prefix of the given list (whose length is
determined by the integer passed as the second argument to
#dyncode("list_split")) and the second part consists of the rest.

</p>

<p>

The given implementation of #dyncode("mergesort") exemplifies
the so-called divide-and-conquer strategy for problem-solving.
The (inner) function #dyncode("msort") divides a given problem
into two subproblems; after recursively solving them, it combines
the returned solutions into a solution to the original problem.
It is straightforward to parallelize the function #dyncode("msort")
by initiating two threads for handling the two recursive
calls in the body of #dyncode("msort") and then joining these two
threads to obtain the values they return. In a programming language
like Erlang where threads are extremely light-weighted, parallelizing
#dyncode("msort") in such a manner may make sense. If threads are not
light-weighted (e.g., pthreads), doing so often leads to poor performance
at run-time. Also, joining threads involves explicit synchronization
and can have a great negative impact on concurrency.

</p>

<h2>
Issues on Parallelizing Mergesort
</h2>

<p>
One common approach to lowering the overhead of creating and destroying
threads is to start a pool of threads. Instead of creating a thread to
perform a particular piece of work, this piece can be inserted into some
kind of store shared by the pool of threads so as to allow one of them to
pick up the piece and then execute it. Also, a thread can return to the
pool (instead of simply exiting) after it completes a piece of
work. With this appraoch, the overhead of creating and destroying threads
is spread over the pieces of work done by these threads.
</p>

<p>
However, there is a caveat that one must pay close attention to when
utilizing a thread pool. In general, each piece of work passed to this pool
should not cause blocking for otherwise a scenario can readily occur where
all of the threads in the pool are blocked (and thus no progress can be
made in terms of work completion). This is especially true when a problem
is solved recursively (e.g., by using the divide-and-conquer strategy).
</p>

<p>
It should soon become clear that #dyncode("msort") can be implemented in a
continuation-passing style (CPS) that allows a problem to be divided into
non-blocking subproblems, which one can pass directly to a thread pool
without running any risk of potential deadlocking.
</p>

<h2>
Mergesort of Continuation-Passing style
</h2>

<p>

A sequential implementation of #dyncode("mergesort") is given as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats('\
implement
{a}(*tmp*)
mergesort{n}(xs) =
msort(xs, length(xs), lam ys => ys) where
{
//
typedef res = list(a, n)
//
fun
msort{n:int}
(
xs: list(a, n), n: int(n), f: list(a, n) -> res
) : res =
(
if
(n >= 2)
then let
//
val n2 = n / 2
val
(xs1, xs2) =
list_split<a>(xs, n2)
//
in
//
msort
( xs1, n2
, lam(ys1) =>
  msort(xs2, n-n2, lam(ys2) => f(list_merge<a>(ys1, ys2)))
)
//
end // end of [then]
else f(xs) // end of [else]
) (* end of [msort] *)
//
} (* end of [mergesort] *)
')</pre>

Note that the third argument of #dyncode("msort") (of the name
#dyncode("f")) is a closure function that acts like a continuation.
