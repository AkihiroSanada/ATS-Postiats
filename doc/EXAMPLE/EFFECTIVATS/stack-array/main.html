<h1>
Effective ATS: An Array-Based Stack Implementation
</h1>

ATS advocates a programming paradigm referred to as <em>Programming with
Theorem-Proving</em> (PwTP) in which programs and proofs are syntactically
intertwined.  As proof construction can be highly expensive in terms of
both effort and time, making proper use of unsafe programming features (so
as to avoid explicit proof construction) is often a necessary skill for a
programmer who wants not just only to be able to code in ATS but also to do
it productively. In this article, I would like to present a simple
array-based stack implementation in which one can find certain typical uses
of unsafe programming features in ATS.

<h2>
API for Array-Based Stacks
</h2>

As usual, let us first introduce an abstract type for array-based stacks:

<pre>
absvtype
stkarray_vtype (a:vt@ype+, m:int, n:int) = ptr
</pre>

We then introduce some shorthands as follows:

<pre>
stadef stkarray = stkarray_vtype
vtypedef
stkarray (a:vt0p, m:int) = [n:int] stkarray_vtype (a, m, n)
</pre>

Given a type T, an integer M and another integer N, the type [stkarray(T,
M, N)] is for an array-based stack such that (1) the elements stored in the
stack are of type T, (2) the capacity of the stack is M, and (3) the
current size of the stack is N.  Clearly, M >= N and N >= 0 holds, and this
property is encoded into the type of the following proof function
[lemma_stkarray_param]:
  
<pre>
praxi
lemma_stkarray_param
  {a:vt0p}{m,n:int}
  (!stkarray (INV(a), m, m)): [m >= n; n >= 0] void
// end of [lemma_stkarray_param]
</pre>

<p>

As always, functions are needed for creating and destroying stkarray-values:

<pre>
//
fun{a:vt0p}
stkarray_make_cap
  {m:int} (cap: size_t(m)):<!wrt> stkarray (a, m, 0)
//
fun
stkarray_free{a:vt0p}{m:int} (stkarray (a, m, 0)):<!wrt> void
//
</pre>

For inserting an element, we have the following function:

<pre>
fun{a:vt0p}
stkarray_insert
  {m,n:int | m > n}
(
  stk: !stkarray (a, m, n) >> stkarray (a, m, n+1), x0: a
) :<!wrt> void // endfun
</pre>

Note that [stkarray_insert] can only be called on a stack if its current
size is strictly less than its capacity.

<p>

For taking out an element, we have the following function:

<pre>
fun{a:vt0p}
stkarray_takeout
  {m,n:int | n > 0}
  (stk: !stkarray (a, m, n) >> stkarray (a, m, n-1)):<!wrt> (a)
// end of [stkarray_takeout]
</pre>

Note that [stkarray_takeout] can only be called on a stack if its current
size is positive.

<h2>
Implementation of Array-Based Stacks
</h2>

We can use the following 3-pointer struct in C to reprensent an array-based
stack:

<pre>
typedef
struct {
  atstype_ptr p_beg ; // the beg pointer
  atstype_ptr p_end ; // the end pointer
  atstype_ref p_cur ; // the current pointer
} stkarray_struct ;
</pre>

The pointers [p_beg] and [p_end] point to the beginning and end of the base
array while the pointer [p_cur] points the top of the current stack. Note
that the beginning of the base array is the bottom of the represented
stack.
