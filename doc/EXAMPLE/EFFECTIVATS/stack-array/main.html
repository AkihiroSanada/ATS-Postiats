<h1>
Effective ATS: An Array-Based Stack Implementation
</h1>

ATS advocates a programming paradigm referred to as <em>Programming with
Theorem-Proving</em> (PwTP) in which programs and proofs are syntactically
intertwined.  As proof construction can be highly expensive in terms of
both effort and time, making proper use of unsafe programming features (so
as to avoid explicity proof construction) is often a necessary skill for a
programmer who wants not just to be able to code in ATS but to do so
productively.
