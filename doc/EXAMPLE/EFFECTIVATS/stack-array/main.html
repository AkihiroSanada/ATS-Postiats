<h1>
Effective ATS: An Array-Based Stack Implementation
</h1>

ATS advocates a programming paradigm referred to as <em>Programming with
Theorem-Proving</em> (PwTP) in which programs and proofs are syntactically
intertwined.  As proof construction can be highly expensive in terms of
both effort and time, making proper use of unsafe programming features (so
as to avoid explicity proof construction) is often a necessary skill for a
programmer who wants not just only to be able to code in ATS but also to do
it productively. In this article, I would like to present a simple
array-based stack implementation in which one can find certain typical uses
of unsafe programming features in ATS.

<h2>
API for Array-Based Stacks
</h2>

As usual, let us first introduce an abstract type for array-based stacks:

<pre>
absvtype
stkarray_vtype (a:vt@ype+, m:int, n:int) = ptr
</pre>

We then introduce some shorthands as follows:

<pre>
stadef stkarray = stkarray_vtype
vtypedef
stkarray (a:vt0p, m:int) = [n:int] stkarray_vtype (a, m, n)
</pre>

Given a type T, an integer M and another integer N, the type [stkarray(T,
M, N)] is for an array-based stack such that (1) the elements stored in the
stack are of type T, (2) the capacity of the stack is M, and (3) the
current size of the stack is N.

<p>

As always, functions are needed for creating and destroying stkarray-values:

<pre>
//
fun{a:vt0p}
stkarray_make_cap
  {m:int} (cap: size_t(m)):<!wrt> stkarray (a, m, 0)
//
fun{a:vt0p}
stkarray_free{m:int} (stk: stkarray (a, m, 0)):<!wrt> void
//
</pre>

For inserting an element, we have the following function:

<pre>
fun{a:vt0p}
stkarray_insert
  {m,n:int | m > n}
(
  stk: !stkarray (a, m, n) >> stkarray (a, m, n+1), x0: a
) :<!wrt> void // endfun
</pre>

Note that [stkarray_insert] can only be called on a stack if its current
size is strictly less than its capacity.

<p>

For taking out an element, we have the following function:

<pre>
fun{a:vt0p}
stkarray_takeout
  {m,n:int | n > 0}
  (stk: !stkarray (a, m, n) >> stkarray (a, m, n-1)):<!wrt> (a)
// end of [stkarray_takeout]
</pre>

Note that [stkarray_takeout] can only be called on a stack if its current
size is positive.
