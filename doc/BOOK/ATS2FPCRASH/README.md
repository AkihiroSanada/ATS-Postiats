# Crash into [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/)

HX-2017-06-02:

I have long been wanting to write a set of notes
on functional programming in ATS. Hopefully, I will
be able to carry out the task this time :)

My current plan is to present a crash course on functional programming
that targets a person with some basic knowledge of programming (e.g.,
someone who took one semester of a programming course based on Java or
Python). This course is primarily based on the pure call-by-value functional
core of ATS extended with templates (for handling parametric polymorphism)
